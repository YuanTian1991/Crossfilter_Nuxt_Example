I was born and grown up in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China in 1991. After receiving a BE degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2013, I left for Shanghai to pursue a Ph.D. degree in CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology. In October 2017, I married with my better half `Yi`, and we choiced UK to restart our career.

- I am a **`researcher`**, enjoying the feeling to exlpore, validate, and discover results. And my research topic includes `Epigenomics`, `Bio-software development` .e.g.

- I am also a **`developer`**, sometimes even consuming life for it at night, good at `R`, `JavaScript`, and prefer to do `full-stake` work in development team.

- In my spear time, I like **`movie/book/game`**, and can not find better way to immerse into other's life and story.

- One of my current dream is **`economy`**. I am holding a second bacholar degree of Economy, and really want to be a part/full -time economy PhD student one day, focusing on topics like `inequality`, `social welfare` and `NGO`.

Now I have started my Postdoc Career in London, UCL Cancer Institute, which is an amazing place. Also I am now based in **`Bath`**, a heritage nice city. I am still open to part-time jobs nearby, like Bioinformatics, Web Developer, Data Scientist.
